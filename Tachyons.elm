module Tachyons exposing (..)

{-| [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io/) is _the_ best CSS framework ever. It's an implementation of
what people call "Functional CSS" which makes working with CSS a little bit easier.

In functional CSS you have a ton of little CSS classes that do one thing, and
do it well #unixphilosophy.

Essentially what this means is that can create almost any interface without
writing custom css, you only need to compose different CSS selectors together.
Here is an example:

    div [classes [pa1, red, f1]] []

This will:

  - Add the smallest padding available on all four sides (Padding Around 1)
  - Make the foreground color red (an Accessible friendly version)
  - Make the `font-size` as big as an h1 tag.

There's even responsive versions. Like `p1_ns` that will only add padding
to anything that is "not small" (larger than mobile). This style allows you to easily create responsive mobile interfaces.

The sole transformation rule to go from raw Tachyons to Elm is that dash maps to underscore.

# Working example

To use the library, just put `tachyons.css` somewhere in your elm-html code to add the stylesheet to your document, and then you can do whatever you want!
Here is a small example:

    module Main exposing (..)

    import Tachyons exposing (classes, tachyons)
    import Tachyons.Classes exposing (f1, purple)
    import Html exposing (..)


    main =
        div [ classes [ f1, purple ] ]
            [ tachyons.css
            , text "I'm Purple and big!"
            ]

# Helper Classes

@docs classes, stylesheet, tachyons
-}

import Html exposing (..)
import Html.Attributes exposing (class, href, rel)


{-| This is a helper funciton that will allow you to combine
multiple Tachyons classes (which are strings) are return a
`Html.Attributes`

    div [classes [pa3, red, f1]] []

-}
classes : List String -> Html.Attribute msg
classes stringList =
    class (String.join " " stringList)
